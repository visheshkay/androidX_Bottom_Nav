I have a strong foundation in web development, working extensively with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Node.js. I have experience building full-stack applications using the MERN stack. Additionally, I have hands-on expertise in Android app development, leveraging Java and Kotlin. I am also familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and have dabbled in machine learning, implementing models for data analysis and entity extraction.
